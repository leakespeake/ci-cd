# JENKINS INTEGRATION WITH TERRAFORM
NOTE: These steps are intended to be setup later via **Jenkins Configuration as Code** using the dedicated Configuration as Code plugin, to allow all Jenkins configuration to be orchestrated via a `.yaml` file.

## Terraform Plugin
First logon to Jenkins and install the plugin for Terraform via *Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Available* and search Terraform. 

Post install you'll see the `Terraform installations` section within *Manage Jenkins > Tools*
